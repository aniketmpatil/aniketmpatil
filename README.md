I'm a Robotics (ROS2/C++) Software Engineer at Trossen Robotics. I work on the Perception and Localization software for their AgileX-based rover platflorm. During my master's, I worked on research related to minimalistic vision-based navigation of compact aerial robots with on-board sensing and compute. Before that, I have over 2 years of work experience working as a Machine Learning Developer, Hardware Interface Intern and Robotics Intern, which gave me a wide variety of skills.

Currently, I am a Robotics graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA, USA. I am interested in Robotics and Computer Vision, but I like to explore other areas of Robotics as well in my free time. Speaking of free time, I am also a painter and photographer by passion.
