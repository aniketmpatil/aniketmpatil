Hi, Iâ€™m Aniket Manish Patil â€” a Research Engineer in the Computer Vision team at Magna New Mobility, where I work on vision-based perception modules for a Last-Mile Delivery Robot. My work spans Traffic Light Recognition, Camera Calibration, Depth Estimation, and 3D Scene Reconstruction, supporting the reliable deployment of autonomous systems.

ðŸ”¹ I hold a Masterâ€™s in Robotics Engineering from WPI, where I focused on minimalistic vision-based navigation for compact aerial robots with on-board sensing and compute. \
ðŸ”¹ Earlier, I gained 2+ years of diverse experience as a Machine Learning Developer, Hardware Interface Intern, and Robotics Intern at start-ups in India, working on projects in robotics, image processing, ML, and CAN-based automotive systems.

Iâ€™m passionate about advancing robotics perception and autonomy by bridging research and real-world deployment. Here youâ€™ll find my projects and contributions in computer vision, robotics software, and autonomous systems.
