Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Aniket Patil. I am a Roboticist from India.

Currently, I am a Robotics graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA, USA. I am interested in Robotics and Computer Vision, but I like to explore other areas of Robotics as well in my free time. Speaking of free time, I am also a painter and photographer by passion. 

You can reach me on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aniket-patil97/)
